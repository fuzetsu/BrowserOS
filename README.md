BrowserOS
=========

BrowserOS is a little project that emulates many of the basic features present in a BASH virtual console.

Just load up the URL below and type `help` and press `enter` to see available commands.

To see how to use a specific command type `help` followed by the name of the command (you can also press tab after typing help to help you find the name of the command you need help with).
